# Compliance Officer System

## 🛡️ Overview

The Compliance Officer ensures strict adherence to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for the Vault Progress Server project. This system automatically monitors, detects, and prevents violations of critical deployment practices.

## 🚨 Mission Critical Rules

1. **NEVER do SSH workarounds if automation is failing**
2. **NEVER change config files directly on the server** 
3. **ALWAYS stick to the plan (Ansible → Terraform → Nomad Pack)**
4. **ALWAYS spawn researchers and analysts if automation is failing**
5. **Enforce principle: "One button deployment with minimal manual interaction"**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start Compliance Monitoring
```bash
cd /Users/mlautenschlager/cloudya/vault
node compliance/monitoring/compliance-officer.js
```

### Start Alert System
```bash
node compliance/monitoring/alert-system.js
```

### Check Compliance Status
```bash
# View current compliance report
cat compliance/reports/report.md

# Check violation statistics  
node compliance/violations/violation-tracker.js stats
```

## 📊 Current Status

**Compliance Score:** 100% ✅
- **Total Violations:** 0
- **Critical Violations:** 0
- **Monitoring Status:** ACTIVE
- **Project Phase:** Ansible Bootstrap (43% complete)

## 🔍 Monitoring Capabilities

### File System Monitoring
- `/etc/vault.d/` - Vault configurations
- `/opt/vault/` - Vault installation files
- `/etc/systemd/system/` - Service definitions
- `/etc/nginx/` - Web server configs
- `/etc/ssl/` - SSL certificates

### Command Filtering
Automatically detects and blocks:
- `ssh.*systemctl` - SSH service commands
- `ssh.*vim /etc/` - Direct config editing
- `scp.*config` - Config file transfers
- `sudo.*without.*ansible` - Manual service changes

### Process Monitoring
- Real-time process analysis
- Suspicious command pattern detection
- Manual intervention alerts

## ⚡ Automated Responses

### Critical Violations → BLOCK OPERATION
- SSH workarounds
- Direct config changes
- Immediate system exit with alert

### High Priority → REQUIRE JUSTIFICATION
- Plan sequence deviations
- Manual deployment steps
- Approval workflow activation

### Medium Priority → AUTO SPAWN AGENTS
- Automation failures
- System errors
- Analysis agent deployment:
  - Research Agent: Root cause analysis
  - System Architect: Solution design
  - Analyst Agent: Impact assessment

## 📋 Team Integration

### Before Any Server Changes
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use automation
ansible-playbook -i inventory vault-deploy.yml
terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars  
nomad-pack run vault-cluster

# ❌ WRONG - Will be blocked
ssh server 'sudo systemctl restart vault'
ssh server 'sudo vim /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl'
```

### When Automation Fails
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Spawn analysis agents
node spawn-agent.js researcher "Investigate vault deployment failure"
node spawn-agent.js analyst "Analyze system dependencies"
node spawn-agent.js system-architect "Design fix for automation"

# ❌ WRONG - Will be blocked  
ssh server 'sudo systemctl start vault'
```

## 🤖 Integration with Agent System

The Compliance Officer works with the existing agent ecosystem:

### Compliant Agent Spawning
```bash
# Compliance Officer automatically spawns agents for failures
# Manual spawning for analysis:
node spawn-agent.js researcher "Compliance investigation" 
node spawn-agent.js system-architect "IaC solution design"
node spawn-agent.js analyst "Process optimization"
```

### Agent Coordination
- Agents must follow IaC principles
- All changes through automation
- No direct server modifications
- Proper documentation required

## 📞 Support

### Issues and Questions
- **System Issues:** Check logs in `compliance/logs/`
- **Policy Questions:** Review `compliance/procedures/`
- **Violations:** Check `compliance/violations/`
- **Technical Support:** Contact DevOps team

### Reporting Bugs
1. Document the compliance issue
2. Include relevant logs
3. Describe expected vs actual behavior
4. Submit through proper channels

## 🎯 Remember: "One button deployment with minimal manual interaction"

**The Compliance Officer is here to ensure our success, not hinder it. By following IaC principles, we achieve:**
- **Faster deployments** (automation vs manual)
- **Fewer errors** (consistent, tested processes)  
- **Better reliability** (reproducible infrastructure)
- **Easier troubleshooting** (documented procedures)
- **Team confidence** (proven, automated workflows)
