## üî¥ Critical Security Issues

### 1. TLS Disabled in Production
**File**: `/config/vault.hcl`, `/scripts/deploy-vault.sh`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: TLS is explicitly disabled (`tls_disable = true`) for all network communications.

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = true  # CRITICAL VULNERABILITY
}
```

**Impact**:
- All API communications transmitted in plaintext
- Sensitive data (tokens, secrets) vulnerable to interception
- Root tokens, unseal keys transmitted without encryption
- Man-in-the-middle attacks possible

**Remediation**:
```hcl
listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable   = false
  tls_cert_file = "/opt/vault/tls/vault.crt"
  tls_key_file  = "/opt/vault/tls/vault.key"
  tls_min_version = "tls12"
}
```

### 2. Plaintext Root Token Storage
**File**: `/scripts/deploy-vault.sh` (lines 211, 234)  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Root tokens stored in plaintext files on filesystem.

```bash
echo "$ROOT_TOKEN" > /root/.vault/root-token  # CRITICAL
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat /root/.vault/root-token)
```

**Impact**:
- Persistent root access vulnerability
- Token compromise enables full Vault takeover
- Violates principle of least privilege
- No token rotation mechanism

**Remediation**:
- Implement secure token wrapping
- Use short-lived tokens only
- Implement automatic token rotation
- Use HSM or external key management

### 3. Insecure Secret Management in CI/CD
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`  
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Unseal keys and init data stored on production servers without proper protection.

```yaml
vault operator init \
  -key-shares=5 \
  -key-threshold=3 \
  -format=json > /opt/vault/init.json  # STORED ON SERVER
```

**Impact**:
- Unseal keys accessible to attackers with server access
- Single point of failure for entire Vault cluster
- No key escrow or secure distribution mechanism

---

## üü† Major Security Issues

### 4. Excessive Admin Privileges
**File**: `/policies/admin.hcl`  
**Risk Level**: MAJOR  
**Issue**: Admin policy grants blanket access to all paths.

```hcl
path "*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
}
```

**Remediation**: Implement granular admin policies with specific path restrictions.

### 5. Missing Audit Logging
**Risk Level**: MAJOR  
**Issue**: No audit logging configuration found in any Vault configuration files.

**Impact**:
- No security event logging
- Compliance violations (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Inability to detect unauthorized access
- No forensic capabilities

**Remediation**:
```hcl
audit "file" {
  file_path = "/opt/vault/logs/audit.log"
}
```

### 6. Weak Systemd Security
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (lines 99-100)  
**Risk Level**: MAJOR  
**Issue**: Vault service runs as root user instead of dedicated service account.

```yaml
User=root
Group=root
```

**Impact**: Privilege escalation if Vault is compromised.

**Remediation**: Use dedicated vault user as shown in `/scripts/deploy-vault.sh`.

### 7. Network Exposure
**File**: `/config/vault.hcl`  
**Risk Level**: MAJOR  
**Issue**: Vault bound to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0:8200`) without network restrictions.

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
  address = "0.0.0.0:8200"  # Exposed to all networks
}
```

---

## üü° Minor Security Issues

### 8. Memory Lock Disabled
**File**: `/config/vault.hcl`  
**Issue**: `disable_mlock = true` allows memory to be swapped to disk.
**Risk**: Secrets could be written to swap files.

### 9. Plaintext Credential Files
**Files**: Multiple scripts create plaintext credential files:
- `/root/traefik-vault-approle.txt`
- `/opt/vault/${SERVICE}-approle.txt`
- `/root/traefik-vault-token.txt`

### 10. Missing Input Validation
**Files**: Various scripts lack input sanitization and validation.

### 11. Hardcoded Paths
**Issue**: Many hardcoded paths reduce deployment flexibility.

### 12. Telemetry Configuration
**File**: `/config/vault.hcl`  
**Issue**: Prometheus retention time very short (30s), may lose metrics.

### 13. Weak Token TTLs
**Files**: `/policies/ci-cd.hcl`, `/scripts/setup-traefik-integration.sh`  
**Issue**: Some tokens have long TTLs (720h) without proper rotation.

## ‚úÖ Security Strengths

### 1. Systemd Hardening (deploy-vault.sh)
```ini
ProtectSystem=full
ProtectHome=read-only
PrivateTmp=yes
PrivateDevices=yes
NoNewPrivileges=yes
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYSLOG CAP_IPC_LOCK
```

### 2. File Permissions
- Proper use of `chmod 600` for sensitive files
- Dedicated vault user and group
- Secure directory permissions (700)

### 3. Policy Segregation
- Well-defined RBAC policies for different roles
- Principle of least privilege in developer/operations policies
- Good separation between admin, developer, operations, and CI/CD roles

### 4. AppRole Authentication
- Proper implementation of AppRole for service authentication
- Reasonable token TTLs and renewal policies
- Secret ID management

### 5. Backup Procedures
- Automated Raft snapshot backups
- Policy and configuration backups
- Timestamped backup directories

## Conclusion

The HashiCorp Vault deployment shows good foundational security practices including proper RBAC policies, systemd hardening, and file permissions. However, **critical security vulnerabilities exist** that require immediate attention, particularly the disabled TLS encryption and insecure root token management.

**Priority Actions**:
1. Enable TLS encryption immediately
2. Implement secure token management
3. Configure audit logging
4. Restrict network access

The deployment is **NOT READY for production use** in its current state due to the critical security issues identified. With the recommended fixes implemented, this would become a secure, compliant Vault deployment suitable for production workloads.

**Risk Rating**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE TO HIGH RISK  
**Recommendation**: DEFER PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT until critical issues resolved
