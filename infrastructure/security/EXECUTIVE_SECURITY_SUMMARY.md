   - Proper systemd security hardening

4. **üèÜ Robust Bootstrap Architecture**
   - Proper dependency resolution (Nomad ‚Üí Vault ‚Üí Traefik)
   - Comprehensive health checking
   - Cleanup on failure
   - Environment-specific configurations

5. **üèÜ Enterprise Security Policies**
   - Complete compliance framework (SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR)
   - Comprehensive RBAC implementation
   - Root token protection mechanisms
   - Cross-service security integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION (4)**

1. **TLS Configuration Gaps**
   - Development environment lacks TLS enforcement
   - HTTP endpoints in bootstrap health checks
   - Mixed TLS configurations across environments

2. **Bootstrap Token Security**
   - Temporary tokens stored in plaintext files
   - Insufficient cleanup of bootstrap credentials
   - No secure memory-only token storage

3. **Network Security Exposure**
   - Services bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Potential external access without proper firewall rules
   - Increased attack surface area

4. **Audit Logging Disabled**
   - Audit devices commented out by default
   - No compliance logging active
   - Forensic capability gaps

---

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MODERATE**

**Risk Factors:**
- Configuration vulnerabilities (not architectural flaws)
- Excellent security framework with implementation gaps
- Strong foundation requiring configuration fixes

### Risk After Remediation: ‚úÖ **LOW**

**Post-Fix Assessment:**
- All critical issues are configuration-based
- Strong architectural security foundation
- Enterprise-ready with proper fixes

---

## Remediation Plan

### üî¥ **IMMEDIATE (24-48 Hours)**
1. Enable TLS across all environments
2. Implement secure bootstrap token handling
3. Enable audit logging by default
4. Restrict network bindings

**Effort**: 2-3 person-days  
**Impact**: Reduces risk from Moderate to Low

### üü† **SHORT-TERM (1 Week)**
1. Configure certificate monitoring
2. Implement security event monitoring
3. Complete backup validation
4. Network security hardening

**Effort**: 1-2 person-weeks  
**Impact**: Enhances monitoring and compliance

### üü° **LONG-TERM (1 Month)**
1. Continuous security monitoring
2. Automated compliance checking
3. Advanced security features (HSM, MFA)
4. Security training and documentation

**Effort**: 1 person-month  
**Impact**: Continuous security improvement
