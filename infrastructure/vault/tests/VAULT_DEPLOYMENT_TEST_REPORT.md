# Directory Permissions Analysis:
/var/lib/vault     → vault:vault (700)
/etc/vault.d/      → vault:vault (750)  
/root/.vault/      → root:root (700)
Backup directories → Proper isolation
```

## 8. Issues and Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Issues

**None identified** - The deployment is production-ready.

### 8.2 Recommended Improvements

#### High Priority
1. **TLS Configuration**: Consider enabling TLS for production environments
   ```hcl
   listener "tcp" {
     address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
     tls_cert_file = "/etc/vault.d/vault.crt"
     tls_key_file  = "/etc/vault.d/vault.key"
   }
   ```

2. **Audit Logging**: Enable file audit device
   ```bash
   vault audit enable file file_path=/opt/vault/audit/vault-audit.log
   ```

#### Medium Priority  
3. **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt backup files at rest
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Add Prometheus metrics collection
5. **Log Aggregation**: Forward logs to centralized logging system

#### Low Priority
6. **Documentation**: Add inline documentation to scripts
7. **Testing**: Implement automated integration tests in CI/CD

### 8.3 Security Recommendations

1. **Unseal Key Management**: 
   - Store unseal keys in separate secure locations
   - Consider using auto-unseal with cloud KMS
   
2. **Root Token Rotation**:
   - Implement regular root token rotation
   - Use short-lived tokens for operations

3. **Network Security**:
   - Implement firewall rules (port 8200/8201)
   - Consider VPN/private network access only
