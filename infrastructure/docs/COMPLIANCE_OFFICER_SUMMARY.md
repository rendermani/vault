## 🔍 KEY VIOLATIONS EVIDENCE

### SSH Root Access Violations
```bash
# Found in infrastructure/scripts/remote-deploy.sh
REMOTE_HOST="root@cloudya.net"
ssh -i "$SSH_KEY_PATH" "$REMOTE_HOST" "$command"

# Found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml  
DEPLOY_USER: "root"
ssh ${{ env.DEPLOY_USER }}@${{ env.DEPLOY_HOST }}
```

### Runtime Configuration Generation
```bash
# Found in remote-deploy.sh - Vault config generated at runtime
cat > $REMOTE_PATH/vault/config/vault.hcl << 'EOVAULTCONF'
ui = true
disable_mlock = false
# ... NOT in version control
```

### Missing Main Repository Workflows
```bash
# Main repository .github directory is EMPTY
/Users/mlautenschlager/cloudya/vault/.github/
# No workflows directory exists in main repo
```

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE RISKS

### Security Risks
- **Root SSH Access**: Direct root access to production servers
- **Untracked Changes**: Configuration changes not auditable  
- **Manual Secret Handling**: Secrets managed outside secure systems
- **No Access Controls**: Unlimited access to production systems

### Operational Risks  
- **Human Error**: Manual processes prone to mistakes
- **Inconsistent Deployments**: No standardized deployment process
- **No Rollback**: Limited automated rollback capabilities
- **Knowledge Silos**: Critical processes dependent on individuals

### Compliance Risks
- **Policy Violations**: Direct violation of automation policies
- **Audit Failures**: Incomplete audit trails
- **Regulatory Risk**: Non-compliance with security regulations
- **Governance Gaps**: No automated policy enforcement
