  run: |
    # Deploy runners with secure configuration
    # Configure runner authentication
    # Test runner connectivity
    # Monitor runner health
```

**Security Requirements**:
- Runners isolated from production networks
- Certificate-based authentication only
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates

### 2. Configuration Management System

**Configuration Structure**:
```bash
infrastructure/
├── config/
│   ├── environments/          # Environment-specific configs
│   ├── templates/             # Configuration templates

├── ENCRYPTION_KEYS
└── API_TOKENS
```

**Secret Rotation Workflow**:
```yaml
# secret-rotation.yml
