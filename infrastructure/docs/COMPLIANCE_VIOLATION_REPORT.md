# COMPLIANCE VIOLATION REPORT
## Infrastructure Deployment Compliance Assessment

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Compliance Officer  
**Status**: CRITICAL VIOLATIONS FOUND  

---

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The infrastructure deployment contains **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS** that directly contradict the established automation and security policies. Multiple manual processes, SSH root access patterns, and missing automation workflows have been identified.

**Overall Compliance Status: üî¥ NON-COMPLIANT**

---

## ‚ùå CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

### 1. **MANUAL SSH ROOT ACCESS PATTERNS**

**Violation**: Direct SSH root access to production servers violating the "NO MANUAL COMMANDS" rule.

**Evidence Found**:
- `infrastructure/scripts/remote-deploy.sh` - Lines 12, 48, 103, 166, 224, 688+ 
  ```bash
  REMOTE_HOST="root@cloudya.net"
  ssh -i "$SSH_KEY_PATH" -o ConnectTimeout=30 "$REMOTE_HOST" "$command"
  ```

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Lines 48, 103, 224, 299+
  ```yaml
  DEPLOY_USER: "root"
  ssh ${{ env.DEPLOY_USER }}@${{ env.DEPLOY_HOST }}
  ```

- `infrastructure/.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml` - Lines 55, 223, 324+
  ```yaml
  REMOTE_USER: "root"
  ssh ${{ env.REMOTE_USER }}@${{ env.REMOTE_SERVER }}
  ```

### 2. **PRODUCTION COMMANDS EXECUTED ON SERVER**

**Violation**: Manual command execution on production server bypassing automation.

**Evidence**:
- Direct curl downloads to production: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh`
- Manual package installations: `apt-get install -y -qq`
- Direct system modifications: `systemctl restart docker`
- File system operations: `mkdir -p /opt/cloudya-infrastructure`

### 3. **MISSING GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS**

**Violation**: No main repository `.github/workflows` directory exists for automated deployment.

**Evidence**:
- Main repository `/Users/mlautenschlager/cloudya/vault/.github` is **EMPTY**
- All workflows are in nested subdirectories, not in main repo
- No central automation pipeline for the entire infrastructure

### 4. **CONFIGURATION NOT IN VERSION CONTROL**

**Violation**: Critical configurations generated on-the-fly instead of being version controlled.

**Evidence**:
- Dynamic Vault configuration generation in `remote-deploy.sh` lines 573-599
- On-the-fly systemd service creation lines 535-569, 622-642
- Runtime Docker configuration generation lines 534-554
- Traefik configuration created during deployment lines 744-862

### 5. **NON-REPRODUCIBLE DEPLOYMENTS**

**Violation**: Deployments depend on manual steps and runtime decisions.

**Evidence**:
- Interactive confirmation prompts: "Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]"
- Dynamic version fetching: `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest`
- Runtime environment detection and configuration
- Manual token and key management processes

## üìä COMPLIANCE MATRIX

| Rule | Status | Violations Found |
|------|---------|------------------|
| No manual commands on server | ‚ùå FAIL | 15+ scripts with SSH commands |
| All configurations in version control | ‚ùå FAIL | 8+ configs generated at runtime |
| Fully automated deployment | ‚ùå FAIL | Manual steps required |
| Everything reproducible | ‚ùå FAIL | Interactive prompts, dynamic fetching |
| All actions logged and documented | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Some logging, gaps in audit trail |
| GitHub Actions only deployment | ‚ùå FAIL | No main repo workflows |

## üîç DETAILED FINDINGS

### Infrastructure Scripts Analysis

1. **`infrastructure/scripts/remote-deploy.sh`** (1,270 lines)
   - **Violation**: Direct SSH access to `root@cloudya.net`
   - **Risk**: Manual execution, bypass of automation
   - **Lines**: 12, 48, 188, 224, 688+

2. **`infrastructure/scripts/provision-server.sh`** (1,129 lines)
   - **Violation**: Manual server provisioning via SSH
   - **Risk**: Untracked system modifications
   - **Lines**: 11, 158, 188+

3. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** (541 lines)
   - **Violation**: SSH commands within workflow
   - **Risk**: Automation that still requires manual access
   - **Lines**: 94-103, 222-226, 243-253

### Configuration Management Issues

1. **Dynamic Configuration Generation**
   - Vault HCL generated in deployment script (not version controlled)
   - Nomad configuration created at runtime
   - Traefik rules generated during deployment

2. **Missing Version Control**
   - SSL certificate handling not in repo
   - Service configurations not pre-committed
   - Environment-specific configs missing

### Security Violations

1. **SSH Root Access**
   - Direct root SSH access patterns
   - SSH keys managed manually
   - No certificate-based authentication

2. **Secrets Management**
   - Secrets passed via environment variables
   - Manual token rotation processes
   - Unencrypted secret storage patterns

## üîß REQUIRED REMEDIATION

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Create Main Repository GitHub Actions Workflow**
   ```
   /Users/mlautenschlager/cloudya/vault/.github/workflows/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-production.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-staging.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-development.yml
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security-scan.yml
