# REQUIRED AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS
## GitHub Actions Workflows to Replace Manual Processes

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Status**: REQUIRED FOR COMPLIANCE

## üéØ OVERVIEW

This document outlines the GitHub Actions workflows that MUST be implemented to replace the current manual deployment processes and achieve full compliance with automation policies.

---

## üìÅ REQUIRED WORKFLOW STRUCTURE

The main repository **MUST** have the following GitHub Actions workflows:

```
/Users/mlautenschlager/cloudya/vault/.github/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-production.yml          # Production deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-staging.yml             # Staging deployment  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-development.yml         # Development deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-scan.yml              # Security scanning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure-drift.yml       # Infrastructure drift detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup-restore.yml             # Automated backup/restore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ certificate-renewal.yml        # SSL certificate renewal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compliance-check.yml           # Automated compliance validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rollback.yml                   # Automated rollback workflow
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ health-monitoring.yml          # Health checks and monitoring
```
