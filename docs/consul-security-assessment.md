# Consul Security and DNS Assessment Report

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Consul Security Expert  
**Scope:** DNS Services, ACLs, Encryption, Service Mesh Configuration

## Executive Summary

### Current State Analysis
- **Configuration Status:** Basic development setup with minimal security
- **Security Level:** Development-grade (NOT production-ready)
- **DNS Integration:** Present but unconfigured for service discovery
- **Service Mesh:** Connect enabled but not secured

### Critical Security Findings

#### ðŸ”´ High Priority Issues
1. **ACLs Completely Disabled** - No access control
2. **No Gossip Encryption** - Cluster communication unencrypted
3. **TLS Not Configured** - All traffic in plaintext
4. **No Token Management** - Default allow policy
5. **Bind Address 0.0.0.0** - Exposed to all interfaces

#### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues
1. **No DNS Forwarding Configuration** - Limited service discovery
2. **Missing Audit Logging** - No security event tracking
3. **Performance Tuning Absent** - Default settings may not scale
4. **No Backup Configuration** - Data loss risk

## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Access Control Lists (ACLs)

**Current Configuration:**
```hcl
acl = {
  enabled = false
  default_policy = "allow"
}
```

**Issues:**
- ACLs completely disabled
- Default "allow" policy grants universal access
- No token management strategy
- No service-specific permissions

**Recommendations:**
- Enable ACLs immediately for non-development environments
- Implement least-privilege access model
- Create service-specific tokens
- Set up bootstrap token management

### 2. Network Security

**Current Configuration:**
```hcl
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"
client_addr = "0.0.0.0"
```

**Issues:**
- Consul bound to all interfaces (security risk)
- No network segmentation
- Client API accessible from anywhere
- No TLS configuration

### 3. Gossip Protocol Security

**Current State:** No encryption configured

**Missing Configuration:**
- Gossip encryption key
- Secure gossip protocol settings
- Node verification

### 4. DNS Configuration

**Current Issues:**
- No DNS recursors configured
- Missing service discovery forwarding
- No DNS security settings
- Port 53 not configured for DNS forwarding

## DNS Service Discovery Analysis

### Current Capabilities
- Basic service registration via Connect
- Default DNS on port 8600
- No external DNS integration

### Missing Features
1. **DNS Forwarding to External Resolvers**
2. **Service Health-based DNS Responses** 
3. **DNS Caching Configuration**
4. **Secure DNS over TLS**
5. **Split-horizon DNS Setup**

## Service Mesh (Connect) Assessment

### Current Configuration
```hcl
connect {
  enabled = true
}
```

### Security Gaps
1. **No CA Configuration** - Using default self-signed CA
2. **No Intention Policies** - All services can communicate
3. **Missing Proxy Configuration** - No sidecar security
4. **No mTLS Enforcement** - Optional mutual TLS

## Environment-Specific Recommendations

### Development Environment
- âœ… Current setup acceptable for local development
- Enable basic ACLs for testing
- Add gossip encryption for security learning

### Staging Environment  
- **CRITICAL:** Enable full ACL system
- Configure TLS for all communications
- Implement gossip encryption
- Set up audit logging
- Configure external DNS integration

### Production Environment
- **MANDATORY:** All staging recommendations plus:
- Multi-datacenter security
- Hardware security modules for keys
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Performance tuning

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Security Control | Development | Staging | Production |
|----------|------------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| P0 | ACL System | Optional | Required | Required |
| P0 | Gossip Encryption | Optional | Required | Required |
| P0 | TLS Configuration | No | Required | Required |
| P1 | DNS Security | No | Recommended | Required |
| P1 | Audit Logging | No | Required | Required |
| P2 | Performance Tuning | No | Recommended | Required |
| P2 | Monitoring | Basic | Required | Required |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Next 24 hours):**
   - Review and approve security recommendations
   - Plan ACL implementation strategy
   - Design token management workflow

2. **Short-term (Next Week):**
   - Implement staging security configuration
   - Set up automation scripts
   - Configure DNS forwarding
   - Test service mesh security

3. **Long-term (Next Month):**
   - Production security hardening
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Disaster recovery procedures
   - Performance optimization

This assessment provides the foundation for transforming the current development-grade Consul setup into a production-ready, secure service discovery and mesh solution.
