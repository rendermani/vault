# Infrastructure Deployment Analysis Report

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Analyst:** Infrastructure Analyst Lead  
**Target Server:** 65.109.81.169 (internal.cloudya.net)

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** All infrastructure services are DOWN. No ports are accessible except SSH (22).

## GitHub Actions Status

- **Status:** Repository access unavailable
- **Error:** "Repository not found or no access" for `mlautenschlager/cloudya-vault-infra`
- **Authentication:** GitHub CLI authenticated but missing required token scopes
- **Impact:** Cannot verify deployment pipeline status

## DNS Resolution Results

✅ **DNS Working Correctly**
- All domains resolve to the correct IP: `65.109.81.169`
- CNAME structure working: All domains → `internal.cloudya.net` → `65.109.81.169`

| Domain | Status | IP Address |
|--------|--------|------------|
| consul.cloudya.net | ✅ Resolves | 65.109.81.169 |
| vault.cloudya.net | ✅ Resolves | 65.109.81.169 |
| traefik.cloudya.net | ✅ Resolves | 65.109.81.169 |
| nomad.cloudya.net | ❌ NXDOMAIN | Not configured |

## Connectivity Test Results

### Server Connectivity
- **Ping Test:** ✅ Server is reachable (avg: 56.8ms)
- **SSH Access:** ✅ Port 22 open and accessible

### Service Ports - ALL FAILED ❌

| Service | Port | Protocol | Status | Error |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Traefik HTTPS | 443 | HTTPS | ❌ Connection Refused | Failed to connect after 62ms |
| Traefik HTTP | 80 | HTTP | ❌ Connection Refused | Failed to connect after 57ms |
| Vault | 8200 | HTTP | ❌ Connection Refused | Failed to connect after 59ms |
| Consul | 8500 | HTTP | ❌ Connection Refused | Failed to connect after 77ms |
| Nomad | 4646 | HTTP | ❌ DNS Error | nomad.cloudya.net: NXDOMAIN |

### SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis
- **Status:** ❌ No SSL certificates found
- **Port 443:** Not responding
- **OpenSSL Test:** Connection refused

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Service Deployment Failure**
   - No services are running on expected ports
   - All application ports (80, 443, 4646, 8200, 8500) show "Connection Refused"
   - This indicates services are not started or crashed

2. **DNS Configuration Gap**
   - `nomad.cloudya.net` not configured in DNS
   - Missing CNAME record for Nomad service

3. **SSL/TLS Infrastructure Missing**
   - No certificates provisioned
   - Port 443 not accepting connections
   - Traefik (reverse proxy) likely not running

4. **GitHub Actions Access Issue**
   - Cannot verify deployment pipeline status
   - Missing repository access or incorrect repository path

### Critical System State:
- ✅ Server is online and SSH accessible
- ✅ DNS resolution working for configured domains
- ❌ ALL infrastructure services are down
- ❌ No web services responding
- ❌ No SSL/TLS termination active

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1):
1. **SSH into server** to check service status:
   ```bash
   systemctl status docker
   docker ps -a
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. **Verify deployment artifacts** are present on server
3. **Check service logs** for startup errors
4. **Restart infrastructure stack** if needed

### Secondary Actions (Priority 2):
1. **Fix GitHub repository access** to monitor deployments
2. **Add DNS record** for `nomad.cloudya.net`
3. **Verify SSL certificate provisioning** process

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3):
1. **Implement health checks** and monitoring
2. **Set up automated alerts** for service failures
3. **Document recovery procedures**

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** Critical (Complete service outage)
- **Business Impact:** All Cloudya infrastructure services unavailable
- **Security Impact:** No HTTPS endpoints accessible
- **Recovery Time:** Unknown until server investigation

## Next Steps

The infrastructure requires immediate SSH investigation to:
1. Determine why services are not running
2. Check Docker/container status
3. Review deployment logs
4. Restart failed services

**Recommendation:** Proceed with server SSH access to diagnose and resolve the service outage.
