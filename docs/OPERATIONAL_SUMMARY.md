## üîë CRITICAL TOKEN AND KEY LOCATIONS

### üìç WHERE YOUR TOKENS AND KEYS ARE STORED

**Root Token:**
- **Primary Location**: `/root/.vault/root-token`
- **Secure Storage**: `/etc/vault.d/secure/tokens/root-token.enc` (if security system enabled)
- **Retrieval Command**: `sudo cat /root/.vault/root-token`

**Unseal Keys:**
- **Primary Location**: `/opt/vault/init.json` (contains all 5 keys)
- **Retrieval Commands**: 
  ```bash
  # View all unseal keys
  sudo jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[]' /opt/vault/init.json
  
  # Get specific key (0-4)
  sudo jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[0]' /opt/vault/init.json
  ```

**Initialization Data:**
- **Complete File**: `/opt/vault/init.json` (contains tokens + keys + metadata)
- **Backup Location**: `/etc/vault.d/secure/backup/`
- **Contains**: Root token, 5 unseal keys, thresholds, metadata

## üöÄ QUICK START COMMANDS

### Emergency Access
```bash
# Get root token
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(sudo cat /root/.vault/root-token)

# Unseal vault (use first 3 keys)
vault operator unseal $(sudo jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[0]' /opt/vault/init.json)
vault operator unseal $(sudo jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[1]' /opt/vault/init.json)
vault operator unseal $(sudo jq -r '.unseal_keys_b64[2]' /opt/vault/init.json)

# Login to vault
vault login $VAULT_TOKEN
```

### Health Check Dashboard
```bash
# Quick status check
/vault/scripts/status-dashboard.sh

# Real-time monitoring
/vault/scripts/realtime-performance-dashboard.sh

# Comprehensive health check
/vault/scripts/daily-health-check.sh
```

### Backup and Recovery
```bash
# Create backup
/vault/scripts/continuous-backup.sh

# List backups
ls -la /backups/vault/

# Emergency recovery (if needed)
/vault/scripts/deploy-vault.sh --action restore /backups/vault/BACKUP_NAME/
```
